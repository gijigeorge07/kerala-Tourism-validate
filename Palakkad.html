              Palakkad is a vast stretch of fertile plains interspersed with
              hills, rivers, mountain streams and forests. The gateway to Kerala
              from the north, a 40 kilometre break in the mountains known as the
              Palakkad Gap gives access to this land situated at the foot of the
              Western Ghats. The pass acts as a corridor between Kerala and the
              neighbouring Tamil Nadu and played a key role in the trade
              relations between the east and west coasts of peninsular India.
              Deriving its name from the Malayalam words Pala
              (Alsteriascholaris) and Kadu (forest), this place was once a
              stunning expanse of forest covered with the sweet-scented flowers
              of the Pala tree. A potpourri of Tamil and Kerala culture, some of
              the finest Carnatic musicians hail from this district which
              continues to be a principally agrarian society.

                  military base in the past. Rebuilt by Hyder Ali in the 18th
                  century, the fort was under the Mysore rulers until the
                  British took control of the place. It was then used for
                  providing government services during the British era.

                  cloud-caressed peaks of the majestic Nelliyampathy Hill ranges
                  are a sight to behold. The height of the hills ranges from 467
                  m to 1,572 m and it has an extremely calming effect on all who
                  view it. To reach Nelliyampathy, one has to take the road
                  starting from Nenmara that proceeds to the Pothundy Dam. There
                  are about 10 hairpin bends that have to be negotiated on the
                  way to Nelliyampathy.

                  The eerie silence, emphasised by the missing Cicadas that gave
                  Silent Valley its name, may make you feel and hear things you
                  could never have imagined. A few centuries ago, before humans
                  reached the Silent Valley, this reserve of tropical
                  rainforests stood undisturbed and tranquil like a perfectly
                  hidden diamond.Located in the Northeast corner of Palakkad
                  district, Silent Valley was named a National Park only in
                  1984.
